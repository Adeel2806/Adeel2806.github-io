      <h3>Adeel Ahmed</h3>
      <p> Prior to coming to city i had little experience and knowledge when it came to coding. 
	  Previsously during my time in college i did complete a few coding tasks within visual basic, 
	  however these tasks were small in number and were quite basic. During coding bootcamp i have 
	  been given a crash course on how to code on Java which i plan to develop during my degree.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Earth and Moon scene</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of loops and randomness. I created a earth scene in which the earth spins 
	and during this a pattern simialr to the pattern of a kleidascope is presented. The 
	pattern continously changes and i did this to represent how the planet of earth keeps 
	changing as it spins as the earth does not look the same all the way around it and 
	where the land and ocens are does differ from time to time through things such as 
	floods or sea rise. To create this pattern i used a series of balls that go around 
	in a circle.These balls are attached to keep eathother in pairs to create multiple 
	lines and as they spin these lines are what makes the pattern. I then used a 3D 
	sphere to create the moon that would orbit the meterphorical earth at an equal distance. 
	To do this i used a variable called Angle and a rotate function to  make sure that the 
	'moon' is always at a equal distnace. Finally i also used randomness for the stars so 
	that apeear in different locaitions as the earth and monn spin i did this to give it a 
	more realistic feel as the earth that i created does not look the same to the earth that 
	we are used to seeing. in phase two i plan to add more then one star into the background 
	in random locaitions.
